# DigiGirls Sales Dashboard (Capstone Project)

This project presents a comprehensive sales analysis capstone project I did during a data analysis training(DigiGirls), through a detailed and interactive Power BI dashboard. The analysis focuses on understanding total cost, total profit, units sold, and overall profitability, while providing a breakdown of performance across different regions, products, and sales channels.

## Project Highlights

The **Sales Dashboard** is designed to provide a high-level overview and detailed breakdowns of key business metrics, enabling decision-makers to track sales performance across multiple dimensions.

## Methodology

The creation of this sales dashboard involved the following steps:

### 1. Data Collection
The sales dataset was provided in an Excel file by The Digigirls Platform, It contains raw sales information across various regions, time periods, product categories, and sales channels.

### 2. Data Cleaning
Using the ETL(Extract,Transform,Load) process.I imported and transformed the dataset using Power query editor, several steps that were taken to clean and prepare the data:

- **Handling Missing Data**: Missing values in fields like region, product category, or sales channel were either filled based on previous trends or flagged for further investigation.
- **Removing Duplicates**: The dataset was scanned for duplicate entries, which were removed to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Data Type Correction**: Ensured that all columns had the correct data types (e.g., dates, numbers, categories) for smooth analysis in Power BI.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and reviewed any anomalies in sales figures that could potentially skew the results.
- **Standardization**: Units of measurement were standardized across the dataset to ensure consistency (e.g., converting regional sales to a common currency).

### 3. Data Import & Transformation
The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI, where further transformations were carried out:
- **Calculated Columns**: New columns were created in Power BI to calculate metrics like profit, profit margin, and year-over-year sales growth.
- **Data Relationships**: Relationships between various data tables (e.g., sales, products, regions) were established to allow for multi-dimensional analysis.

### 4. Visualization Development
The dashboard was designed to be interactive and user-friendly:
- **Filters**: Filters for region, country, product category, and sales channel were added to allow users to customize their view of the data.
- **Visual Elements**: Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables were used to present the data in a visually appealing and easily digestible format.
### Key Metrics:
1. **Total Cost**: 
   - Represents the cumulative cost of goods sold and associated operational expenses.
   - In this analysis, the total cost is **9bn**, reflecting the investment required for producing and distributing 50M units of products globally.

2. **Total Profit**:
   - Calculated as the difference between total revenue and total costs.
   - The dashboard shows a total profit of **4bn**, indicating that the business has generated a solid margin over its operational costs. This profit is derived from the sales of various product lines across multiple regions.

3. **Units Sold**:
   - Tracks the total number of items sold across all regions and channels.
   - The dashboard records **50M units sold**, highlighting significant market penetration, especially in high-demand regions like North America and Europe.

4. **Profit Margin**:
   - Profit margin is a critical indicator of overall efficiency and profitability. It is calculated as:  
     \[
     \text{Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Total Revenue}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - The current profit margin stands at **29.63%**, reflecting strong financial performance and efficient cost management.

### Additional Metrics:
- **Revenue by Region**: Breakdown of total revenue from North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and other regions.
- **Sales by Product Category**: Insights into how each product line (e.g., beverages, clothes, cosmetics) contributes to overall revenue.
- **Sales Channel**: Revenue split between online and offline sales.

## Key Visualizations

- **Total Revenue by Month**: A line chart that tracks monthly revenue trends, providing insight into sales growth and seasonality.
- **Top 5 Regions by Revenue**: A bar chart showing the top regions generating the most revenue.
- **Total Revenue by Sales Channel**: A pie chart representing the split between online and offline sales.
- **Revenue by Product Category**: A table summarizing revenue by different product categories, such as baby food, cosmetics, household items, etc.
- **Top 5 and Bottom 5 Countries by Revenue**: Comparative bar charts displaying the countries with the highest and lowest sales revenue.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: Used to develop the interactive dashboard and perform advanced data visualizations.
- **Excel**: The raw sales data was cleaned, standardized, and prepared using Excel prior to importing into Power BI for analysis.


## Insights from the Dashboard

The dashboard provides key insights into:
- **Profitability**: With a 29.63% profit margin, the company shows strong financial health.
- **Geographical Performance**: The revenue breakdown by region allows for targeted strategies in high-performing markets.
- **Product Analysis**: Understanding which product categories drive the most revenue helps in inventory and marketing optimization.
- **Sales Channels**: Analysis of online vs offline sales performance helps allocate resources to the most profitable channels.

## Future Work

To enhance this project, potential improvements include:
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Automating the data import process for real-time dashboard updates.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Adding customer demographic data to the analysis for more personalized insights.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Incorporating machine learning models to predict future sales trends based on historical data.
